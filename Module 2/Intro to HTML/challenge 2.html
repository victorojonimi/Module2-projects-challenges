        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. <em>We all start at 0.</em></strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein<em>couldn’t count to 10.</em></strong> <br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare<em>had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</em></strong> <br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a <em>Little bit stronger.</em></strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This is learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        <strong>Because the most beautiful,</strong> complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
